# Decision-Tree-from-scratch
Two decision trees using scikitlearn for small datasets, and one decision tree from scratch for a larger dataset. The first two problems are related to the samll datasets and the third problem is the decision tree from scratch, which shows 87% accuracy when the entire dataset is used and is the same as the scikitlearn decision tree accuracy. The data, all the python files, and a brief report is attached.
